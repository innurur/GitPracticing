        here we will practice some branches
        cause I still dont know the point
        why and where should we use it

    now im working in a different branch and
    will see the difference between
    checking out  and merging strict and
    checking out without merging
    but using the VCS merge

        then we should work and see the result
        of merge conflict
        after that we should just practice with the group
