        here we will practice some branches
        cause I still dont know the point
        why and where should we use it

    now im working in a different branch and
    will see the difference between
    checking out  and merging strict and
    checking out without merging
    but using the VCS merge

        then we should work and see the result
        of merge conflict
        after that we should just practice with the group


also I personally should practice to clone the project
because everytime I was creating it
and I have to practice collaboration
but the other way

        by the way in order to practice
        I have to re-watch the video
        it gonna take some time
        but better to do it today

        so we have 4 types of solving problem with the merge conflict
        they are:
        abort merge
        accept yours - in this case all others code will be lost
        accept their - in this case my code will be lost
        merge - in this case we can transfer changes in ont place, but it is not safe
        because we can do some changes too

        a little bit confused, but
        will practice it tomorrow as well
        and will make a meeting with the group
        and practice one more time
