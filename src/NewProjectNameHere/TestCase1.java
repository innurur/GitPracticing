     First we have to create a package
     then we have to go to VCS and enable the version control
    in order for Git take care of the changes
    then we have to do some work
    and create some java classes
    and the send it or Share Project with GitHub
    in this case we can share the work with the team

    still working in branch3
    and need to understand the logic
    and try to make merge conflict after that

    interesting can I still work under the branch4 and make some changes
    here as well
    will see what will happen

    no changes in a new branch is not allowed
    adding changes in branch that previously
    took care of this work will cause the conflict
    mostly I used abort merge option
      */
